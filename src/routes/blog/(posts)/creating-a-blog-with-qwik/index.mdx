In this blog post, we'll explore how to create a website to host a personal blog using the [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) frontend framework. Qwik is designed for instant loading and high performance, making it an excellent choice for building modern web applications and an interesting framework to expore.

## Introduction

Qwik is a cutting-edge framework from the creator of Angular that aims to provide an instant-loading experience for web applications. In this guide, I will walk you through the steps to create a blog website from scratch using Qwik.

On their [official website](https://qwik.dev/), the Qwik team provide a great high-level overview of how Qwik differs from other frontend frameworks:

> **General-purpose**: Qwik can be used to build any type of web site or application.
>
> **Instant-on**: Unlike other frameworks, Qwik is resumable which means Qwik applications require 0 hydration. This allows Qwik apps to have instant-on interactivity, regardless of size or complexity.
>
> **Optimized for speed**: Qwik has unprecedented performance, offering sub-second full page loads even on mobile devices. Qwik achieves this by delivering pure HTML, and incrementally loading JS only as-needed.

Additionally, Qwik uses JSX for templating, which makes it easy to get started for developers familiar with React.

Does all this make it the perfect choice for _all_ new projects? Probably not. Does it make it perfect for a blog? Not necessarily. But does it make it an interesting choice to explore and learn about? Absolutely! So let's get started.

## Setting Up the Environment

First, make sure you have Node installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), or you can use NVM, the Node Version Manager. You can learn more about NVM on their [GitHub](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

I will be using pnpm as my package manager, but you can use npm or yarn if you prefer. Just swap out `pnpm` for `npm` or `yarn` in the commands below.

## Creating a New Qwik Project

Once you have your package manager set up, you can create a new Qwik project. Open your terminal and run:

```
pnpm create qwik@latest
```

You will be prompted to choose a template for the project and to enter a project name. We'll use the "empty" template, and put it in `./my-blog`. The CLI will create a new directory called `my-blog` and set up the project structure for you.

Navigate to the directory:

```
cd my-blog
```

Install the dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

## Building the Blog Layout

Let's set up the basic layout of our blog.

### Creating the Header Component

In the `src/components` directory, create a new file called `index.tsx` under a new folder called `header`.

This structure allows us to group everything related to the component in one place, such as styles, tests, and sub-components you can use to break up complexities. A minor additional benefit is it will allow us to shorten the imports we use for it. For example `components/header` instead of `components/header/header`.

You can forego the additional file structure and simply keep a file called `header.tsx` at the root of `components` if you prefer. Feel free to organize your files in any way that makes sense to you.

Add the following code to the new file. Add styling and other details as you like. I will not be covering styling in this guide, but Qwik supports just about any strategy for styling you could want, including CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules, Tailwind, and more.

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { Link } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"

export const Header = component$(() => {
  return (
    <header>
      <Link href="/">
        <strong>My Blog</strong>
      </Link>

      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link href="/posts/">Posts</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link href="#">About</Link>
          </li>
          ... More links here ...
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
  )
})
```

In this component, we are creating a simple header that will be present on all pages. We are using the `component$` function from Qwik to define the component. You will notice the dollar sign a lot in Qwik. You can think of it as indicating a lazy loading boundary, which allows Qwik to load the component only when it is needed. You can read more about defining components in the [Qwik documentation](https://qwik.dev/docs/components/overview/).

We also use the `Link` component to create links to different pages in the blog. The `Link` component handles client-side, single page navigation. Interestingly, a Qwik app can be either a single page application or a multi-page application depending on how you structure your routes. Instead of `Link`, we could use the standard HTML `a` tag to trigger full page navigation. You can even have both in the same app, depending on your needs. Read more about Qwik routing [here](https://qwik.dev/docs/routing/).

<aside>
  While adding this component you may have noticed the `router-head.tsx` file,
  created automatically by the Qwik CLI. This is used to define the metadata for
  the HTML `head` section of the document. We will see more related to `head`
  content later in this guide.
</aside>

### Adding the Header to the Main Layout

Edit the `src/routes/layout.tsx` file to include the `Header` component:

```tsx
import { component$, Slot } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import type { RequestHandler } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"
import { Header } from "~/components/header"

...
// Default caching code at base route
...

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <Slot />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
})
```

Qwik uses a file based routing system similar to other frameworks, such as Next.js. This `layout.tsx` file is the main layout component that will be used for all pages in the application. Layouts must be named `layout` and export a default component. Pages will be rendered inside the `Slot` component, which acts as a placeholder for the content of each page, similar to `children` in React. You can read more about slots in the [Qwik documentation](https://qwik.dev/docs/components/slots/).

### Adding a home page

Update the `index.tsx` in the `src/routes` directory. Copy and paste the following code to the file, or add something more interesting!

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { Link, type DocumentHead } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>
      <p>
        There isn't much here yet, so why not check out my{" "}
        <Link href="/posts/">posts</Link>?
      </p>
    </>
  )
})

export const head: DocumentHead = {
  title: "My Blog",
  meta: [
    {
      name: "description",
      content: "A blog for all things me",
    },
  ],
}
```

The only new thing here is the `DocumentHead` object. This is used to define the metadata for the HTML `head` section of the document. The `title` property is used to set the title of the page, and the `meta` array is used to define additional metadata. Anything you can add to standard HTML head sections can be added here.

## Adding Blog Posts

Layouts will not be rendered on thier own, but are instead used as a wrapper around the content of each page. In order to render a page, Qwik requires an `index.(tsx,jsx,mdx)` at the base of each path. So let's get something on the screen by creating a blog post!

There are many possible ways to structure a blog in Qwik, but for simplicity, we will create our posts using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which is a Markdown language that allows you to import and use JSX components. Qwik supports MDX [out of the box](https://qwik.dev/docs/guides/mdx/), and comiles it to Qwik components. This makes it a great way to write content heavy web pages like blog posts. It may not be ideal for non technical writers, or for blog sites that have users as authors, like Medium. But it works great for personal blogs. Especially if you are a developer who is comfortable with Markdown and navigating the file structure of a codebase.

Since Qwik uses a file based router, the directory structure will determine the URL of the blog post. For example, a post in `src/routes/posts/my-blog-post/` will be accessible in the website at `/posts/my-blog-post/`.

We will do something similar to this, but with a slight twist. We will use the following structure under the routes directory (including the layout and index files we created earlier):

```
| routes
| -- posts
|    -- (posts)
|      -- my-blog-post
|        -- index.mdx
|      -- layout.mdx
|      -- posts.ts
|    -- index.tsx
| -- index.tsx
| -- layout.tsx
```

This looks mostly like what we discussed earlier, with the exception of the `(posts)` directory. In another similarity to Next.js, the parenthesis indicate that this part of the path is ignored by the router. For example `posts/(posts)/my-blog-post/index.mdx` becomes `posts/my-blog-post/` in the browser. This is a way to group related files together without creating a new route. In this case, we are adding the extra folder in order to create a new `layout.tsx` file that will help structure the content of each individual post page below it.

Qwik also supports dynamic routes. Since we are writing our posts directly in markdown, we are defining the path explicitly instead. But if you were using a database to store and retrieve posts, you could use square brackets in the folder name to define a route variable. For example, `src/routes/posts/[title]/index.tsx` would match the path `/posts/:title/`, where `:title` is any string representing a blog post title. You could then use the `title` variable in your component to fetch the post content and display it in your page.

Go ahead and create the necessary files and directories in your project.

### Creating a New Blog Post

Let's create a new blog post using MDX.

If you haven't already, create a file with the path `src/routes/posts/(posts)/my-blog-post/index.mdx`. Add anything you like to this file, but here is a small example:

```md
---
title: My First Blog Post
description: A totally rad blog post!
author: Evan Douglass
keywords: qwik, blog, tutorial
og:
  - title: true
    description: true
  - image: /images/my-image.jpg
    image:alt: A picture of me
---

Welcome to my blog!
```

The content wrapped in dashes at the top of the file is called frontmatter. It is used to define metadata about the post, including title, description, author, and keywords. The frontmatter section can contain any arbitrary data, but anything that is named the same as well known HTML `meta` tags will be added to the document's `head` section as that tag, such as all the lines here. This is optional, but it is good practice to include it for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and for sharing on social media. Read more about setting HTML head tags in the [Qwik documentation](https://qwik.dev/docs/api/#usedocumenthead).

You can also use this information in other Qwik files. We will see this shortly. Notice we do not provide a main heading in the body of the markdown. This is intentional, because we will use the information in the frontmatter to display the title and date of the post seperately. This will allow us to more easily provide custom styles for the header of the article.

<aside>
  The `og` object is used to define Open Graph metadata, which is used by
  platforms like Facebook and Twitter to display rich previews of your content
  when shared (think of cards with an image, title, and description). Setting
  the Open Graph title and description to `true` just means that these take the
  same values as the previously declared values of the same name.
</aside>

Create a layout for the post - and all future posts - at `src/routes/posts/(posts)/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Slot, component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { useDocumentHead } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"
import { formatDate } from "~/utils/formatDate"

export default component$(() => {
  // Get metadata and frontmatter
  const head = useDocumentHead()

  return (
    <article>
      <header>
        <h1>{head.title}</h1>
        <time dateTime={head.frontmatter.date}>
          <span>{formatDate(head.frontmatter.date)}</span>
        </time>
      </header>
      <section>
        <Slot />
      </section>
    </article>
  )
})
```

Style this in any way you prefer. You can view the top of this very blog post as an example if you would like!

`formatDate` is a simple helper function to create a well formatted date string. It is defined by the code below, but feel free to adjust it to your tastes. You can add this to a new file in the `utils` directory, or in the same file as the component. You can remove the export if opting for the latter.

```ts
export function formatDate(dateString: string) {
  return new Date(`${dateString}T00:00:00Z`).toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
    day: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    year: "numeric",
    timeZone: "UTC",
  })
}
```

You should now be able to view the post at `http://localhost:5174/posts/my-blog-post`.

There is still something missing though. Users don't have a way to browse posts yet!

## Adding a List of Blog Posts

In order to allow users to view blog posts, they must be able to browse through them. There may be better ways to do this. But for the sake of simplicity, we will keep a constant that lists all the posts and cycle through them to create a list of previous posts that users can look through.

In `src/routes/posts/(posts)/posts.ts` add the code below. There are a lot of `posts` in this path, which may start to get confusing. As a quick reminder, the first is the router path, the second is used for grouping files without adding to the router path, and the last is storing references to your posts.

```ts
export interface Post {
  slug: string
  title: string
  description: string
}

export const POSTS: Readonly<Post[]> = [
  {
    slug: "creating-a-blog-with-qwik",
    title: "Creating a Blog Website with Qwik",
    description:
      "Learn how to create a blog website using the Qwik frontend framework.",
  },
]
```

This is a simple array of objects that represent data for each post. You can add as many posts as you like, and you can add more properties to each post depending on what you need. Add new posts to the top of the array to keep the list in reverse chronological order, as you would view it in the browser.

Next, add the following code to `src/routes/posts/(posts)/index.tsx` to display the list of posts.

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { Link } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"
import { POSTS } from "./posts"

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {POSTS.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.slug}>
            <Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>
              <h2>{post.title}</h2>
            </Link>
            <p>{post.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
})
```

And with that we have a working blog!

## Conclusion

There is a _lot_ more work needed on this starter code to get ready for deployment. But with the basic buiding blocks in place, you can start adding elements and experimenting with Qwik. As a learning exercise, I encourage you to build on this code and see what you can create. Or take what you have learned to build out an entirely new project. The Qwik documentation is a great resource to help you along the way.

Some important things we did not cover in this post are state management and component life-cycles. These are some of the more interesting parts of Qwik, and will be important to understand to evaluate if Qwik is right for your next project. The developer ergonomics of using these features are similar to React, so should make them easy to pick up if you already know React. But they do behave slightly differently. Be sure to read the [documentation](https://qwik.dev/docs/components/state/ to understand how they work. I'll cover these topics more in future posts as well.

### Deploying Your Blog

When you are ready to deploy, Qwik has several ready-made integrations with popular hosting platforms, including AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Vercel, Netlify, and more. You can read more about deploying applications [here](https://qwik.dev/docs/deployments/).
