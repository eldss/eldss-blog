# Creating a Blog Website with Qwik

In this blog post, we'll explore how to create a blog website using the [Qwik frontend framework](https://qwik.dev/). Qwik is designed for instant loading and high performance, making it an excellent choice for building modern web applications.

## Introduction

Qwik is a cutting-edge framework from the creator of Angular that aims to provide an instant-loading experience for web applications. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to create a blog website from scratch using Qwik.

On their [official website](https://qwik.dev/), the Qwik team provide a great high-level overview of how Qwik differs from other frontend frameworks with thier "Qwik Goals":

> **General-purpose**: Qwik can be used to build any type of web site or application.

> **Instant-on**: Unlike other frameworks, Qwik is resumable which means Qwik applications require 0 hydration. This allows Qwik apps to have instant-on interactivity, regardless of size or complexity.

> **Optimized for speed**: Qwik has unprecedented performance, offering sub-second full page loads even on mobile devices. Qwik achieves this by delivering pure HTML, and incrementally loading JS only as-needed.

Additionally, Qwik uses JSX for templating, which makes it easy to get started for developers familiar with React or other JSX-based frameworks.

Does all this make it the perfect choice for all new projects? Probably not. Does it make it perfect for a blog? Not necessarily. But does it make it an interesting choice to explore and learn about? Absolutely! So let's get started!

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we start, make sure you have Node installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), or you can use NVM, the Node Version Manager. You can learn more about NVM on their [GitHub](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

I will be using pnpm as my package manager, but you can use npm or yarn if you prefer. Just swap out `pnpm` for `npm` or `yarn` in the commands below.

## Creating a New Qwik Project

Once you have your package manager set up, you can create a new Qwik project. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pnpm create qwik@latest
```

You will be prompted to choose a template for the project and to enter a project name. We'll use the "empty" template, and put it in `./my-blog`. The CLI will create a new directory called `my-blog` and set up the project structure for you.

Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd my-blog
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Building the Blog Layout

Let's start by setting up the basic layout of our blog.

### Creating the Header Component

In the `src/components` directory, create a new file called `index.tsx` under a new folder called `header`.

Naming the file `index.tsx` will allow us to shorten the imports we use for it. For example `components/header` instead of `components/header/header`. We could also forego the additional file structure and simply keep a file called `header.tsx` at the root of `components`, and that would work as well. But our structure allows us to group everything related to the component in one place, such as styles and tests. We will not be covering styling or testing in this guide, so feel free to organize your files in any way that makes sense to you. For example, this structure may be less useful if you are using Tailwind CSS and don't need separate stylesheets for each component.

Add the following code to the new file:

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { Link } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"

export const Header = component$(() => {
  return (
    <header>
      <div aria-label="Logo">
        <Link href="/">My Qwik Blog</Link>
      </div>

      <nav aria-label="Main Navigation">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link href="/">Home</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link href="/posts">Posts</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
  )
})
```

In this component, we are creating a simple header that will be present on all pages. We are using the `component$` function from Qwik to define the component. You can think of the dollar sign as indicating a lazy loading boundary, which allows Qwik to load the component only when it is needed. You will see this often in Qwik applications. You can read more about defining components in the [Qwik documentation](https://qwik.dev/docs/components/overview/).

We also use the `Link` component to create links to different pages in the blog. The `Link` component handles client-side, single page navigation. Interestingly, a Qwik app can be either a single page application (SPA) or a multi-page application (MPA) depending on how you structure your routes. Instead of `Link`, we could use the standard HTML `a` tag to trigger full page navigation. You can even have both in the same app, depending on your needs. Read more about Qwik routing [here](https://qwik.dev/docs/routing/).

<aside>
  While adding this component you may have noticed the `router-head.tsx` file.
  This is used to define the metadata for the HTML `head` section of the
  document. We will see more related to `head` content later in this guide.
</aside>

### Adding the Header to the Main Layout

Edit the `src/routes/layout.tsx` file to include the `Header` component:

```tsx
import { component$, Slot } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { Header } from "../components/header"

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <Slot />
      </main>
    </>
  )
})
```

Qwik uses a file based routing system similar to other frameworks, such as Next.js. This `layout.tsx` file is the main layout component that will be used for all pages in the application. Layouts must be named `layout` and export a default component. Pages will be rendered inside the `Slot` component, which acts as a placeholder for the content of each page, similar to `children` in React. You can read more about slots in the [Qwik documentation](https://qwik.dev/docs/components/slots/).

### Adding a home page

Update the `index.tsx` in the `src/routes` directory. Copy and paste the following code to the file, or add something more interesting!

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { Link, type DocumentHead } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>
      <p>
        There isn't much here yet, so why not check out my{" "}
        <Link href="/posts">posts</Link>?
      </p>
    </>
  )
})

export const head: DocumentHead = {
  title: "My Qwik Blog",
  meta: [
    {
      name: "description",
      content: "A blog for all things Qwik",
    },
  ],
}
```

The only new thing here is the `DocumentHead` object. This is used to define the metadata for the HTML `head` section of the document. The `title` property is used to set the title of the page, and the `meta` array is used to define additional metadata. Anything you can add to standard HTML head sections can be added here.

You should now be able to view your site by running the development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

By default, Qwik uses the port `5174`, so you should be able to view the page at `http://localhost:5174/`.

## Adding Blog Posts

Layouts will not be rendered on thier own, but are instead used as a wrapper around the content of each page. In order to render a page, Qwik requires an `index.(tsx,jsx,mdx)` at the base of each path. So let's get something on the screen by creating a blog post!

There are many possible ways to structure a blog in Qwik, but for simplicity, we will create a new folder for each post in a `src/routes/posts` directory. Inside each post's folder, we will create an `index.mdx` file that will contain the content of the post in Markdown format. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a Markdown language that allows you to import and use JSX components. [Qwik supports MDX out of the box](https://qwik.dev/docs/guides/mdx/), and comiles it to Qwik components. This makes it a great way to write content heavy web pages like blog posts.

Since Qwik uses a file based router, the folder structure will determine the URL of the blog post. For example, a post in `src/routes/posts/my-blog-post` will be accessible in the website at `/posts/my-blog-post`.

Qwik also supports dynamic routes. Since we are writing our posts directly in markdown, in the file system, we are defining the path explicitly instead. But if you were using a database to store and retrieve posts, you could use square brackets in the folder name to define a route variable. For example, `src/routes/posts/[title]/index.tsx` would match the path `/posts/:title`, where `:title` is any string representing a blog post title. You could then use the `title` variable in your component to fetch the post content and display it in your page.

### Creating a New Blog Post

Create a file with the path `src/routes/posts/my-blog-post/index.mdx`. Add anything you like to this file, but here is a small example:

```md
---
title: My First Blog Post
description: A totally rad blog post!
author: Evan Douglass
keywords: qwik, blog, tutorial
og:
  - title: true
    description: true
  - image: /images/my-image.jpg
    image:alt: A picture of me
---

# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog!
```

Notice the content wrapped in dashes at the top of the file. This is called frontmatter, and it is used to define metadata about the post. In this case, we are defining the title and description of the post. The `og` object is used to define Open Graph metadata, which is used by platforms like Facebook and Twitter to display rich previews of your content when shared. Setting the Open Graph title and description to `true` just means that these take the same values as the previously declared values of the same name.

The frontmatter section can contain any arbitrary data, but anything that is named the same as well known HTML `meta` tags will be added to the document's `head` section as such. This is optional, but it is good practice to include it for SEO and social sharing purposes. Read more about setting HTML head tags in the [Qwik documentation](https://qwik.dev/docs/api/#usedocumenthead).

You should now be able to view the post at `http://localhost:5174/posts/my-blog-post`.

There is still something missing though. Users don't have a way to browse posts yet!

## Adding a List of Blog Posts

There may be better ways to do this, but for the sake of simplicity, we will keep a constant that lists all the posts and cycle through them to create a table of contents. It won't look great, but it will be functional. As an exercise, try implementing a `Card` component to display each post in a more modern way.

Create a new file at `src/routes/posts/posts.ts` to store the list of posts:

```ts
export interface Post {
  slug: string
  title: string
  description: string
}

export const POSTS: Readonly<Post[]> = [
  {
    slug: "creating-a-blog-with-qwik",
    title: "Creating a Blog Website with Qwik",
    description:
      "Learn how to create a blog website using the Qwik frontend framework.",
  },
]
```

Then create a new file at `src/routes/posts/index.tsx` to display the list of posts:

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik"
import { Link } from "@builder.io/qwik-city"
import { POSTS } from "./posts"

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {POSTS.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.slug}>
            <Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>
              <h2>{post.title}</h2>
            </Link>
            <p>{post.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
})
```

And with that we have a working blog!

## Conclusion

Now, this won't win any design awards, and there is a lot more work needed to get ready for deployment. But with the basic buiding blogs in place, you can start to experiment with Qwik and see if it is the right choice for your next project.

When you are ready to deploy, Qwik has several ready-made integrations with popular hosting platforms, including AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Vercel, Netlify. You can read more about deploying Qwik applications [here](https://qwik.dev/docs/deployments/).
